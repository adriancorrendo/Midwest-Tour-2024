The [Plant Agriculture Field Trip course](https://www.plant.uoguelph.ca/mwtour-course), which is better known around campus as the Midwest Tour, is a field study course designed to increase the student's breadth of knowledge of agricultural production and agri-business in North America. Students in the course tour a selected area of the US Midwest Region prior to the fall semester, visiting cash crop and livestock farms, supporting industries (e.g. processing, manufacturing) and markets (e.g. elevators, stockyards)
